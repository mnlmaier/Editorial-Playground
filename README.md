This is a repo containing stuff I used to test out some CSS properties during the writing of my Bachelor's Thesis. You can toggle several features and have a look at how the different settings affect the readability of the given dummy text.

*You can check out the whole thing on [https://mnlmaier.github.io/editorial-playground/](https://mnlmaier.github.io/editorial-playground/).*
